tell them that it also changes the behaviour of moving a tab just inside a group instead of skipping the first tab

tell them that the default is to skip groups

tell them that the other issue will have to wait for this one because of the options menu

waitaminute, you can use an array in chrome.tabs.move and you can use -1 to specify the end of the window

if going to the beggining or end it should never group

does it work with saved groups?

you removed the pinned tabs code

do you still need the isTabGoingRight? just use group and ungroup

option to wrap around?

what happens if you disable skip closed groups?

does pinned tabs (multiple) work?
